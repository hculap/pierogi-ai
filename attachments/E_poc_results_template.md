# Proof of Concept (PoC) Results

**PoC Title:** [Brief, descriptive title of the experiment]

**Date:** [Date of the summary]

---

### 1. Hypothesis

*What did we believe would happen?*

**We hypothesized that by using [AI solution/tool], we could achieve [specific outcome] for [target audience/process].**

*Example: We hypothesized that by using a sentiment analysis model on customer feedback emails, we could automatically categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral with at least 90% accuracy.*

### 2. Key Metrics (KPIs)

*How did we measure success?*

| Metric          | Baseline (Before) | Result (After) | Lift/Change | Target |
| --------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| **Primary KPI** | [e.g., 0% auto-categorized] | [e.g., 92% accuracy] | +92% | >90% |
| *Secondary KPI* | [e.g., 15 mins/email] | [e.g., 1 min/email] | -93% | <2 mins |

### 3. Methodology

*What did we do?*

1.  **Data:** [Describe the dataset used, e.g., "A sample of 1,000 anonymized customer feedback emails from the past 3 months."]
2.  **Tools:** [List the tools and technologies used, e.g., "Python with NLTK library, running on a local machine."]
3.  **Process:** [Outline the steps taken, e.g., "1. Pre-processed the text data. 2. Trained a Naive Bayes classifier. 3. Validated the model on a holdout set of 200 emails."]

---

### 4. Results

*What were the outcomes?*

The PoC was **[successful/partially successful/unsuccessful]**.

- **Quantitative Findings:** The model achieved **92% accuracy** in categorizing emails, exceeding our target of 90%. The average time to process an email was reduced from 15 minutes to approximately 1 minute.
- **Qualitative Findings:** The model struggled with sarcasm and ambiguous language, which accounted for most of the errors. The team found the tool easy to use.

### 5. Key Learnings & Next Steps

*What did we learn, and what's next?*

- **Learnings:** The approach is viable and has the potential for significant time savings. However, a more sophisticated model may be needed to handle nuanced language effectively.
- **Decision:** **[Scale / Optimize / Stop]**
- **Next Steps:**
    1.  [Action item, e.g., "Explore using a more advanced model like BERT for improved accuracy."]
    2.  [Action item, e.g., "Develop a plan for integrating the model into the live customer support workflow."]
    3.  [Action item, e.g., "Secure budget for the next phase."]
