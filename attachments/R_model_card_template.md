# Model Card

**Model Name:** [Name of the model]

**Version:** [e.g., 1.0]

**Date:** [Date of this version]

---

### 1. Model Details

- **Model Type:** [e.g., Logistic Regression, Deep Neural Network, Gradient Boosted Trees]
- **Architecture:** [Provide details on the model architecture, e.g., "BERT-base-uncased with a linear classification head."]
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** [e.g., Scikit-learn 1.1, TensorFlow 2.9, PyTorch 1.12]
- **Contact:** [Name or email of the model owner/team]

---

### 2. Intended Use

- **Primary Use Case:** [Describe the primary application, e.g., "To classify incoming customer support tickets into predefined categories (e.g., Billing, Technical Support, General Inquiry)."]
- **Target Users:** [e.g., Customer Support Agents]
- **Out-of-Scope Uses:** [Describe uses that are explicitly not supported, e.g., "This model should not be used to make fully automated decisions without human oversight or for any medical diagnosis."]

---

### 3. Training Data

- **Source:** [Describe the origin of the training data, e.g., "Anonymized historical support tickets from our internal CRM, from Jan 2020 to Dec 2022."]
- **Size:** [e.g., 50,000 records]
- **Preprocessing:** [Describe key preprocessing steps, e.g., "Lowercasing, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization."]
- **Demographics/Groups:** [Describe any known demographic or sensitive groups in the data. Note if this information is not available.]

---

### 4. Evaluation Data

- **Source:** [e.g., "A held-out test set of 5,000 tickets from Jan 2023."]
- **Size:** [e.g., 5,000 records]
- **Data Distribution:** [Describe how the evaluation data distribution compares to the training data. Note any significant differences.]

### 5. Performance Metrics

*Performance metrics are reported on the holdout evaluation set.*

**Overall Performance:**

| Metric    | Value     |
| --------- | --------- |
| Accuracy  | [e.g., 95%] |
| Precision | [e.g., 94%] |
| Recall    | [e.g., 96%] |
| F1-Score  | [e.g., 95%] |

**Performance by Group:**

| Category              | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| *Billing*             | [e.g., 98%] | ...       | ...    | ...      |
| *Technical Support*   | [e.g., 93%] | ...       | ...    | ...      |
| *General Inquiry*     | [e.g., 96%] | ...       | ...    | ...      |

### 6. Ethical Considerations & Limitations

- **Bias:** [Describe any known biases. For example, "The model may be less accurate for tickets written in languages other than English, as the training data was primarily English. Performance was found to be slightly lower for the 'Technical Support' category, which may require further investigation."]
- **Robustness:** [Describe the model's sensitivity to unexpected inputs, e.g., "The model may perform poorly on very short or jargon-heavy tickets."]
- **Transparency & Explainability:** [Describe the extent to which the model's decisions can be explained, e.g., "As a logistic regression model, feature importance can be calculated to provide some level of explainability."]
- **Privacy:** [Describe how privacy is protected, e.g., "All training and evaluation data was anonymized to remove personally identifiable information (PII)."]
